    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Nigerian beans porridge is one of my favourite Nigerian foods to cook, but it has not always been like that. Back when I was a kid, beans was one of the meals I dreaded taking to school for lunch. This was because as kids, we always think beans is a ‘’poor
        man’s food’’ and kids don’t want to be seen as poor. Whenever my mum cooked beans as my lunch for school, I would either pretend to forget it at home or not bring it out during lunch break, so I won’t be mocked by my classmates. As funny as it
        sounds, this belief was common among kids, so I’d rather go hungry than eat beans in school. These days, I barely go a week without eating beans and I will proudly take it to work for lunch.

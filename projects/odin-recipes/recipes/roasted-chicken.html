    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's funny. We nibble on the celery
        after.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup margarine, divided</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed </li>
    </ul>


    <h3> Steps</h3>

            <p>
                Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's
                exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.

                Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes
                before serving.
